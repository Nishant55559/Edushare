    "caption": "Hello everyone. I would like to present the certificate I received for attending the 7- day bootcamp on App Development using Flutter. Conducted early this year by GDSC SMIT and Aryan Lohia, the bootcamp helped me decide my career as an app developer. It help me build my interest towards app development. It was a enlightening experience learning about UI design and development and integrating the app with a backend on Firebase."
